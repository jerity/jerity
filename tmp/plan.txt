1. PropelFormTranslator (and other form-related stuff, e.g. CSS)
2. Image class to handle image resizing, cropping, borders, etc. - essentially what phpThumb does, but better - I already have some code written
3. Error/Exception handler stuff, incl. @-suppression warnings
4. Proper benchmarking/profiling stuff.
5. CSS crunching / investigation of Less.js
6. Finish work on the pluralisation/singularisation stuff in the Inflector
7. Investigate PHP 5.3 namespaces for Jerity and 5.2 interoperability
8. Mapping between ISO country codes and country names
9. Default data lists (e.g. Countries, UK Counties, US States, Months (short/long), etc.) with translation (?)
10. Translation stuff
